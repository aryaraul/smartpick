# SmartPick

SmartPick is a facial recognition-based security system designed to ensure safe and authorized pickup of students by their registered parents or guardians. When a parent arrives to pick up a child, the system verifies the parent's identity by matching their face against a registered database before allowing the student to leave.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition Verification**: Confirms if the person picking up the student is a registered parent or guardian.
- **Security-Focused**: Prevents unauthorized pickups, enhancing student safety.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Quickly matches faces in real-time at the point of pickup.
- **Attendance Logging**: Records pickup events with timestamps and identities.
- **User Management**: Add, update, or remove registered parents in the system.
